src/Crypto/Hash/SHA256.hs:124:11: warning: [-Winline-rule-shadowing]
    Rule "digestSize" may never fire
      because ‘B.length’ might inline first
    Probable fix: add an INLINE[n] or NOINLINE[n] pragma for ‘B.length’

    Rule "hashmany" may never fire
      because rule "Class op foldl" for ‘foldl’ might fire first
    Probable fix: add phase [n] or [~n] to the competing rule
